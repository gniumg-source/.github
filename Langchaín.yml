Trusted by companies shaping the future of agents – including Klarna, Replit, Elastic, and more – LangGraph is a low-level orchestration framework for building, managing, and deploying long-running, stateful agents.

## Get started

Install LangGraph:

```
pip install -U langgraph
```

Create a simple workflow:

```python
from langgraph.graph import START, StateGraph
from typing_extensions import TypedDict


class State(TypedDict):
    text: str


def node_a(state: State) -> dict:
    return {"text": state["text"] + "a"}


def node_b(state: State) -> dict:
    return {"text": state["text"] + "b"}


graph = StateGraph(State)
graph.add_node("node_a", node_a)
graph.add_node("node_b", node_b)
graph.add_edge(START, "node_a")
graph.add_edge("node_a", "node_b")

print(graph.compile().invoke({"text": ""}))
# {'text': 'ab'}
```

Get started with the [LangGraph Quickstart](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/quickstart).

To quickly build agents with LangChain's `create_agent` (built on LangGraph), see the [LangChain Agents documentation](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/agents).

## Core benefits

LangGraph provides low-level supporting infrastructure for *any* long-running, stateful workflow or agent. LangGraph does not abstract prompts or architecture, and provides the following central benefits:

- [Durable execution](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/durable-execution): Build agents that persist through failures and can run for extended periods, automatically resuming from exactly where they left off.
- [Human-in-the-loop](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/interrupts): Seamlessly incorporate human oversight by inspecting and modifying agent state at any point during execution.
- [Comprehensive memory](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/memory): Create truly stateful agents with both short-term working memory for ongoing reasoning and long-term persistent memory across sessions.
- [Debugging with LangSmith](http://www.langchain.com/langsmith): Gain deep visibility into complex agent behavior with visualization tools that trace execution paths, capture state transitions, and provide detailed runtime metrics.
- [Production-ready deployment](https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/app-development): Deploy sophisticated agent systems confidently with scalable infrastructure designed to handle the unique challenges of stateful, long-running workflows.
